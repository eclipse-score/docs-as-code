  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that all Need IDs are globally unique across all included
  documentation instances.

  .. note::
     Within each docs-instance (as managed by sphinx-needs), IDs are guaranteed to be unique.
     When linking across instances, unique prefixes are automatically applied to maintain global uniqueness.

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  .. TODO: is it "indicating" or "perfect match"?
     e.g. workflow -> wf would be ok for "indicating", but not for "perfect match"

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part indicating the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the final part of the feature tree
