Details
----------------------

.. note::
   To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
   for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
   feature description.

   .. note::
      Implementation note (in some sort of DR in the future??).
      IDs are unique within one docs-instance, this is guaranteed by sphinx-needs.
      Several docs-instances are always independent. When they are linked, they always
      receive unique prefixes for their IDs.

   Docs-As-Code shall ensure that Need IDs adhere to the following:

   * Start with the need type (e.g. ``feature__``)
   * Include the feature name (for feature requirements)
      * Requirement Attribute UID: some part of the feature tree / component acronym
      * Architecture Attribute UID: last part of the feature tree
