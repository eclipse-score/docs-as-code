.. needtable::
   :filter: c.this_doc()
   :columns: id;title;satisfies;implemented;
   :style: datatables

Details
----------------------

.. note::
   To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
   for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
   feature description.

----------------------
üìõ ID Rules
----------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID uniqueness
   :id: tool_req__attr_id
   :implemented: YES
   :satisfies:
      PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_uid,
      PROCESS_gd_req__tool__attr_uid,

   Need IDs must be globally unique.

   .. note::
      Implementation note (in some sort of DR in the future??).
      IDs are unique within one docs-instance, this is guaranteed by sphinx-needs.
      Several docs-instances are always independent. When they are linked, they always
      receive unique prefixes for their IDs.

.. tool_req:: Enforces need ID scheme
   :id: tool_req__attr_id_scheme
   :implemented: YES
   :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_uid

   Need IDs must:

   * Start with the need type (e.g. ``feature__``)
   * Include the feature name (for feature requirements)
   * Have additional text

   This applies to needs of type:

   * Stakeholder requirements
   * Feature requirements
   * Component requirements

----------------------
üßæ Title Requirements
----------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces title wording rules
   :id: tool_req__attr_title
   :implemented: PARTIAL
   :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__requirements_attr_title


   Titles must not contain the words:
   * ``shall``
   * ``must``
   * ``will``

   Applies to:

   * stakeholder requirements
   * feature requirements
   * component requirements

   .. warning::
      Process requirement forbids only ``shall``.



---------------------------
üìù Description Requirements
---------------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces presence of description
   :id: tool_req__attr_description
   :implemented: NO
   :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__requirements_attr_description

   Each requirement must contain a non-empty description.

   Applies to:

   * Stakeholder requirement
   * Feature requirement
   * Component requirement
   * Assumption of use requirement
   * Process requirement

   .. warning::
      All those "applies to" need to be matched exactly against available types,
      e.g. "process requirement" is quite vague.


-------------------------
üß† Rationale Requirements
-------------------------

.. tool_req:: Enforces rationale attribute
   :id: tool_req__attr_rationale
   :implemented: YES
   :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_rationale

   * YES
   * NO

   It is mandatory for:

   * stakeholder requirements
   * feature requirements
   * component requirements
   * assumption of use requirements
   * process requirements
   * Tool Verification Report

   .. warning::
      the architecture requirement does not talk about architecture elements, but about requirements.


.. TODO: Double check if this truly isn't implements
.. tool_req:: Restrict linakge of security architecture elements
   :id: tool_req__arch_security_linkage
   :implemented: NO
   :satisfies: PROCESS_gd_req__arch__linkage_security_trace
